<p>Feedback from the CRESH team and input from Laura Macdonald (MRC/CSO SPHSU) facilitated the development of the app. The app was built in Rstudio (0.98.507) with support from the R user community. In particular the guides written by Dean Attali were invaluable. We acknowledge that the data on features of the built environment was supplied by EDINA Digimap. We would also like to acknowledge the support from The University of Glasgow, and The University of Edinburgh.</p>
