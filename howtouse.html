<p><strong>Getting started</strong></p>
<p>Several option boxes are located to the left â€“ 'Local Authorities', 'Feature', and 'Change'. In the 'Local Authorities' option box you can choose from one to five of the 32 local authorities, or the whole of Scotland. If you do not know your local authority, supply your postcode <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">here</a>. By specifying the location of the map in this way you will then be presented with the default options for the data- Feature="Buildings", Change="Loss/no change/gain". You are then able to change these options to dynamically display the data in different ways (e.g. view other features cycle paths, roads, woodland in terms of loss/no change/gain or levels of change (i.e. low or high)). For full information on the options see the 'About' tab. If you get stuck whilst using the application then hover over the option boxes with your cursor, to get some helpful tips instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding the map </strong></p>
<p>
When you have selected the geography and data type then you can explore the map using the map options in the corners of the map. In the bottom left hand corner is the scale bar which will change dynamically as you zoom. In the right hand corner the legend shows the colour coding for change in terms of loss and gain in the chosen feature. In the top left hand corner is the + and - zoom options, so that you can pan around the map to different areas. Below these is the full screen option, which we recommend using for taking screenshots of the maps. On the top right of the map is the basemap options, this includes some well-known layers including CartoDB Positron designed by Stamen, Toner designed by Stamen and Open Street Map (OSM).
Hovering over a cell will turn the boundary black. By clicking a cell a text box will appear containing information on feature counts for the two time points.
