<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The UK has some of the best longitudinal data about people’s lives and their health in the world (e.g. https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/get-data/key-data/cohort-and-longitudinal-studies ) and these have proved incredibly useful in understanding how health and health inequalities are created over time, and how change in people’s individual circumstances can affect their chances of good health. However, in order to understand the role of environment in protecting or harming health, we really need longitudinal data on environment as well which we could join to these data on individuals. Some environmental characteristics such as air pollution, are quite well captured over time but there is a particular gap in data about the built environment, facilities and infrastructure. The data displayed in this app are a product of this project which focused on retrospectively creating longitudinal measures of neighbourhood built and social environment, for very large numbers of towns, cities and settlements. To undertake this task we have been working with Ordnance Survey map data from Digimap (http://digimap.edina.ac.uk) . These maps are regularly updated, so can provide a picture how our built environment changes year to year by comparing one year’s map to the previous years.  We have identified changes in very large numbers of towns and cities, over a relatively short period of time (1 year), and hope to look at change over longer periods (5 to 10 years). We will then join this information on environmental change to data about health and behaviour, asking the extent to which they have been affected.  Our colleagues at CRESH (http://cresh.org.uk ) are doing something similar, but over much longer periods of time.

<p><strong>Methods</p></strong>
<p>
OS Open Map Local (OML) data, and Integrated Transport Network (ITN) Urban Paths data were downloaded from EDINA Digimap for Scotland for October 2016 and October 2017. OML is a detailed street-level open data vector mapping product including buildings, roads, woodland etc., while Urban Paths is a continuous dataset of footpaths, cycle paths etc. A grid was created for Scotland containing 500m2 cells. For built environment change between time points, grid cells were categorised according to loss, gain, or no change, and by low or high level change for each of the chosen features (i.e. buildings, cycle paths, roads and woodland).
